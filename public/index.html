                                <p>The South Omo pastoralist communities are marginalized and live in a remote area. As a result, much is not known about the communities and their surroundings. Providing fruitful development interventions in the area requires sufficient knowledge about the situations on the ground. It is in this context that EPaRDA, as implied in its name, is engaged in action-oriented researches and studies in selected areas of development and peace. Since its establishment, EPaRDA  conducted  several researches and studies have been conducted and practical steps have been taken based on the findings. The following are the major studies  conducted to date.</p><strong>Ethno veterinary research</strong><p>A study on indigenous herbal practices of South Omo pastoralists against external parasite was conducted in  Tsemay wereda. The objectives of the study  include:    to  ascertain  the efficiency of plant species  previously used by pastoralists of South Omo, to treat animals infested with helminthes parasites, to identify new plant species to be used in the treatment of livestock  and to teach the pastoral communities about the protection and conservation of these medicinal plants in the coming 10 years through the use of extension workers. </p><strong>Resource inventory and mapping</strong><p>Resource inventory and mapping survey was conducted. As a result of the survey key rangeland and water areas, shared resources for the livestock and wildlife, dry land reserves and potential conflict areas, migratory pattern of  the target pastoral communities  and land use pattern of agro pastoral communities were identified and recommendations were drawn. It is being used for various interventions in the area.</p><strong>Socio-economic survey</strong><p>The socio-  economic survey on the economic and nutritional return of pastoralisim, agro-pastoralisim and rain fed/irrigated farming was conducted.</p><strong>Camel adaptability trial</strong><p> Considering that  the area does not  have much  grazing land rather better suited for browsers, EPaRDA took the  initiative to  introduce camels into the project area  as action research. Camel adaptability trial was done for a year with 10 camels brought in the project area. The result was successful and EPaRDA is providing the communities with camels and other organizations are adopting the method.</p><strong>Dry meat research</strong><p>This was one of the trials conducted with the aim of facilitating livestock marketing. For the purpose, demonstration slaughterhouse and meat drying house were constructed. The trial was carried out for over three months. The preliminary results showed that, it is profitable to sell livestock in the form of dry meat rather than live animals that incur cost from additional transportation and other related costs. </p><strong>Sorghum transplantation</strong><p>Since the area is suffering from shortage of rain, the rain that falls is not enough to grow crops till seed setting. The crops usually dry without setting seed. In order to solve this problem, EPaRDA conducted sorghum transplantation trial. The outcome of the trial showed that the seedlings transplanted performed well and set seeds earlier than the crops planted. EPaRDA shared the outcomes with the communities and implementation is underway.</p><strong>Harmonization of modern and traditional laws and gender in peace building – the case of South Omo</strong><p>This study investigates ways of harmonizing traditional and modern laws for a more fruitful peace building process in the area. In addition, the study tried to  take into consideration the role of women in peace building. The outcome has been used for various peace building interventions in the area.</p><strong>Post conflict trauma Rehabilitation study</strong><p>Due to recurrent inter ethnic conflict and the post conflict trauma that usually last long in the communities, EPaRDA conducted post conflict trauma rehabilitation study. The study tried to identify ways and methodologies to overcome the trauma.</p><strong> Agronomy study in the four woredas of the South Omo Zone</strong><p>This study focuses  mainly on analyzing the existing farming practices in Bena Tsemay, Hamer, Dassench and Nyangatom woredas. The study is conducted by taking into account traditional farming practices of the communities.  It demonstrates  the great contribution of dry land farming to enhance food security in the study areas by introducing improved technologies.</p><strong>Best practices documentation</strong><p>The documentation of best practices and important project activities has been in place in EPaRDA with a view of sharing experiences and consolidate efforts. EPaRDA prepared various audiovisual materials and publications of the best practices in various sectors of intervention to use them as a source document in the future endeavor and for other interested stakeholders. </p>

                                <strong>Livestock</strong><p>The most common character of pastoralists is their acquaintance with livestock in their livelihood. In South Omo Zone, by and large, the communities’ livelihood depends mainly on livestock. Ensuring food security in the area should primarily focus on making use of the existing large livestock resource. However, a poor animal health situation and backward system production is the main features that affect the livestock productivity. Eventually, the  communities’ livelihood is subject to chronic food insecurity.</p><p>Making use of what the surrounding provides is always a strategy for all food security and other interventions of EPaRDA. In this regard, EPaRDA has designed projects that ensure utmost utili zation of the communities’ livestock resource by improving the poor health situations and production systems. In this regard several projects that directly or indirectly related to livestock resource of the communities of South Omo are designed and implemented in cooperation with partner organizations and stockholders.</p><p>A base line survey on animal health and productivity is conducted in order to guide EPaRDA and other stockholders interventions. EPaRDA’s livestock health interventions in South Omo Zone have above all improved the livestock health situation. Under this program, the trainings of Community Animal Health Workers from within the communities are conducted and have contributed a lot in creating improved access to livestock health services in the area. Likewise, the repeatedly conducted livestock vaccinations have widely reduced the prevalence of livestock disease epidemics.</p><p> Though Camel is a remarkably performing drought resistant livestock in other pastoral areas of Ethiopia, it was not know by the communities of South Omo. Taking  note  of that EPaRDA implemented Camel adaptability trial in South Omo  Zone and achieve successful results. This is one of the important initiatives, which EPaRDA embarked up on for food security reasons. According to the information gathered from Asile, Kola-kaja and Shala-luka kebeles, where EPaRDA has hitherto distributed  camels, their number has grown up remarkably and they are reproducing very well. As a result of this, currently the beneficiary communities are effectively utilizing the camels as a source of milk, meat and transport. After observing the wide benefits of  camels, there has grown a wide interest among the communities in South Omo and a lot of pastoralists have currently registered to own camels even on full cost recovery basis. Such interventions are vital in boosting the pastoralist food security</p><strong>Agriculture Promotion</strong><p>In South Omo Zone, mainly in areas with vegetation and flora, and supportive weather condition, beekeeping is has a good potential. The communities practice traditional beekeeping. However, the traditional beekeeping practice was less productive. Therefore, promotion of modern apiculture is one of the food security supplementary initiatives of EPaRDA in the area.</p><p> Accordingly, twenty interested traditional beekeepers were identified as a model. They were trained in beekeeping/apicultural production techniques, beehives management and honey handling methods, and beehives were distributed to them. The beneficiaries are presently enjoying improved honey production as a result of the support. They are getting additional incomes for their household that ultimately contributes to their food security. Following the success of the first round model beneficiaries, other community groups as well as concerned government offices are requesting for similar supports. Currently, EPaRDA is responding to these demands and the initiative will be strengthened.</p><strong>Fishery</strong><p>Therefore, fishery promotion is another vital initiative launched by EPaRDA for improving the food security of the pastoralist communities.</p><p>The communities of Dassenech Woreda, that lives along Lake Turkana practice traditional fishing in small amount. Similar to other pastoralist communities in the area, the Dassenech  community mainly engaged in livestock raring. They were living with chronic problems related to food security. It is in a view of creating alternative means of livelihood that EPaRDA designed a project that give the community an opportunity to make use of the resource that exist in their surrounding, the Omo River. The project was funded by Cordaid.</p><p> Accordingly, 16 fishing boats and 65 fishing nets provided to about 154 households. They are using the fish products both for home consumption and for marketing to obtain additional income. EPaRDA has also linked the beneficiaries with the Ethiopian Fish Corporation for the purpose of creating sustainable market opportunity to the pastoralist fishermen. In addition to this, EPaRDA, in collaboration with the Ethiopian Fish Corporation, trained those fishing groups on fishing techniques, boats operation, and use of the high yielding fishing nets. Moreover, around 15 women were trained in fishing  -  net making and on how to market their produce. The fishermen are linked with the net-making women so that they can get additional nets when the need arises</p><strong>Small Scale Irrigation</strong><p>Primarily, utilizing what is available in the surrounding is the focus of EPaRDA’s interventions. What advantages does the environment provides in meeting the food security problem? In the case of South Omo, the two permanent rivers, the Omo and the Waito, should come first. The communities that live alongside the rivers usually practice flood retreat farming. They farm after the rivers over flow and water the surrounding of the riverbank. It is in this consideration that EPaRDA started to introduce modern Small Scale Irrigation and strengthening the traditional ones. </p><p>EPaRDA has so far introduced food security enhancing irrigation cultivation in five sites namely Gola and Karo (Hamer woreda); Lochuch and Selegn (Dassenech woreda); and Omo Kibish (Nyangatom woreda). In these irrigation schemes, around 2000 pastoralist and agro-pastoralist households have benefited and harvested about 10,000 quintals of food grains (maize and sorghum mainly) from a total area close to 500 hectares. As a result of this magnificent impact, the communities in these locations have relatively became food secure as compared to other community groups in South Omo, and this situation can be understood from the assertion made by the Gola communities in Hamer, “We do not need food aid, rather we are in the position of donating food to our relatives”</p> <strong>Water Development</strong>
                                <p> Water scarcity, erratic rainfall, scarcity of hydrological and other related information, limited promotion of water harvesting, conflict over water resources and the spread of water born diseases have long been known as the prominent challenges facing the pastoralist communities in South Omo Zone. As a result of this, EPaRDA pursued the development of water infrastructures, especially water ponds, and the strengthening of community water management capacities in the target areas. EPaRDA has so far undertaken construction of four water ponds in Gisma (Bena-Tsemay woreda), Arbore (Hamer woreda), Omorate zuria (Dassenech woreda) and Nyangatom woreda, and established water use committees and provide training on water utilization.</p>

                                <p class="item-intro text-muted">Provide basic integrated services, particularly focusing on needs of women and children.</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/health-preview.png" alt="">
                                <p>The major threats to pastoralists’ health stems from:    frequent drought and flooding, malaria, and women’s and children’s medical problems resulting from child birth. Prevalence of traditional harmful practices such as the giving of birth alone outside  of home remains a big challenge.  EPaRDA’s main objective in this sector is to provide basic integrated services, particularly focusing on needs of women and children.<br>The main interventions so far EPaRDA has undertaken include: <br>
                                        •   Establishment of mobile clinics accessible to 80,000 people<br> 
                                        •   Constructed and equipped of eleven birth huts with trained attendants,<br>
                                        •   Training of community health workers to carry out immunization ,<br>
                                        •   Introduce health insurance scheams and establishing over 20 Health Insurance groups  ,<br>
                                        •   Offering of basic health education through youth clubs ,<br>
                                        •   Establishing pastoralist health committees, <br>
                                        •   Equip health centers with  safe abortion kit, safe delivery kit and contraceptives,<br>
                                        •   Health education through mobile outreach camps,<br>
                                        •   Training of tradition Birth Attendants first to enhance  their skill and provide with delivery kits; and later shifting their role as only  health promoters that works in strengthening referral linkage to health facilities and promote institutional delivery.  <br>
                                        •   support  monthly outreach  Extended Program of  Immunization  for almost a decade that covers over 60 kebeles  , <br>

                                        •   provide various trainings for Health professionals on Basic Emergency Management of Obstetric Care, Safe and Clean Delivery, STI diagnosis and management protocol, family  planning, and other health subjects,<br>
                                        •   Support mobile VCT activates with logistical support and <br>
                                        •   Research, Knowledge Transfer & Networking <br>
                                <p>Approaching HIV/AIDS interventions among communities require a thorough understanding of the cultural nuances of the communities in question. EPaRDA, quickly recognized that as long as early interventions are not done in prevention and awareness creation, the HIV/AIDS pandemic could pose a serious challenge to development work in pastoral areas of South Omo zone. A survey conducted by EPaRDA in 2006 revealed that the level of awareness of the pastoral communities towards HIV/AIDs in South Omo zone was at only 11.6%. In addition, only 10.6% of the respondents identified three or more ways of being infected with HIV/AIDS and means of prevention. The information gap on the HIV/AIDS epidemic is influenced by factors such as the area being one of the most marginalized areas of the country, the communities’ transhumant lifestyle and traditional practices that encourage having multiple sexual partners. There is also scarcity of partners for testing, education and treatment of diseases.</p><p>In the face of these challenges, EPaRDA launched and implemented a project in 2002 in the woredas where there had been no prior intervention and since then EPaRDA has been intervening on HIV/AIDS as crosscutting issue. A subsequent project began in 2008, focused upon bringing about the necessary behavioral changes by improving the awareness and capacity of the community towards the transmission and prevention of the disease. </p><p>The approaches taken by EPaRDA include: Awareness creation; Voluntary Counseling and Testing (VCT) training; training of traditional healers in preventive HIV/AIDS counseling; training of volunteers and HIV positive people on HIV/AIDS education and advocacy; organizing forums for discussions, such as workshops, youth and music clubs; the establishment of sexual and reproductive health clubs; launching of mobile outreach VCT services; the production and distribution of educational materials, as well as the establishment of associations of people living with HIV/AIDS. It is equally important that a more aggressive approach to improving the provision of antiretroviral therapy (ART) is taken.</p>

                                <p>Non-formal education has played a critical role in the capacity building program of EPaRDA. This was a project initiated by the community after  assessing  EPaRDA’s successful  performance in other capacity building initiatives in areas such as livestock keeping, income generating and others mentioned earlier. In 2002, the pastoralist community  requested EPaRDA  for introduction of a non-formal education system relevant to their life style. EPaRDA in collaboration with PACT Ethiopia established six non-formal education sites Birale, Bilibilo, kola Keja, karo, Shaba Mero and Shalla in Bena -Tsemay and Hamer woredas. The project targeted 300 children for non  -  formal education and facilitated the project by provision of materials, training centers, trained manpower and formation of school management committee in collaboration with the communities.  Among the targeted 300 students 90% registered at the initial stage and later on 172 more adults joined the program and a total of 443 benefited.</p>

                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/emergency-preview.png" alt="">
                                <p>The  patoralists in  the  South  Omo  zone  where  EPaRDA  has  been  working  for  are  vulnerable  for  natural hazardous  such  as  drought  and  flood.  EPaRDA’s  pioneering  effort  was  put  in  place  in  2005  with funding from cord aid. A contingency fund system was developed in 2005 within this project and a start up  project  of  250,000  Ethiopian  birr  was  allocated.  This  has  helped  in  carrying  out  swift  emergency operations  to  save  the  lives  of  victims  of  flood  and  was  a  remarkable  step  in  overcoming  the  delays  in emergency  supplies  that  result  from  the  usual  lengthy  process  of  fund  appropriation  at  the  time  of emergencies. </p><p>On  August  13,  2006,  the  Omo  River  flooded  around  14  villages  in  the  Dassenech  and  Nyangatom woredas  of  the  zone.  Consequently,  364  people  were  killed,  21,523  people  were  displaced,  and  more than 3,200 livestock  died  and  around  1,225 local  grain  storages  containing  2,280 quintals  of  grain  were destroyed.</p><p> EPaRDA  was  the  first  to  appear  on  the  scene  of  the  incident  with  emergency  support  a  day  after  the flood.  EPaRDA’s  operations  were  focused  on  relief,  human  health,  livestock  health,  and  emergency peace  and  security  administration  interventions.  The  interventions  were  through  the  funds  provided  by cord  aid,  Health  Unlimited,  Pastoralist  Forum  Ethiopia  (PFE),  Oxfam  GB  and  the  United  Nations Office  of  Humanitarian  Affairs  (UNOCHA). The  EPaRDA  health  team  composed  of  2  medical  doctors and  two  nurses  gave  humanitarian  assistance  and  the  necessary  support  to  22,544  flood  victims.  The majority  were  women,  children  and  elders.  There  was  no  early  preparedness  for  such  a  crisis  on  the government  side,  so  EPaRDA  mobilized  emergency  funds  from  its  health  project  funded  by  Health unlimited  to  cover  the  cost  of  medicines,  daily  subsistence  allowance,  and  logistics  support  for government heath staff. Furthermore, EPaRDA secured emergency funds form Oxfam GB, cord aid and PFE  for  hygiene  and  environment  sanitation  to  purchase  and  distribute  materials  for  displaced  people during  the  first  phase  of  the  emergency  operations.  Disease  like  pneumonia,  dysentery,  measles  and others  emerged  as  a  result  of  this  crisis.  EPaRDa  deployed  a  medical  team  led  by  a  doctor  to  provide emergency  care  to  the  displaced  people.  Also  vaccinations  and  treatment  were  given  to  428,133 livestock against different diseases that would have caused an outbreak following the flooding.</p><p> Similarly,  the  flooding  that  occurred  in  2007  in  three  woredas:  Hammer,  Dassenech  and  Nyangatom, was  devastating  both  in  its  extent  and  geographic  coverage  compared  to  the  2006  flood.  Early preparations  made  by  EPaRDA  in  collaboration  with  donors  and  government-especially  at  woreda  and zonal level saved lives and properties. </p><p>The  threat  of  flooding  of  the  Omo  and  Woito  rivers  is  a  regular  phenomenon  hitting  the  low-lying woredas  of  south-Omo  zone:  Dassenech,  Nyaangatom,  and  Hamer.  From  the  past  experiences,  the flooding of the Omo River starts from Mid-August and continues until the first week of October. </p><p>In  Addition  to  conducting  emergency  relief  efforts,  EPaRDA  is  engaged  in  disaster  preparedness  and risk  aversion  operations.  The  risk  aversion  activities  were  put  into  practice  in  2009  and  helped  to  save the  communities  from  the  possible  destruction  of  the  flood.  EPaRDA  has  at  disposal  emergency contingency projects to support the communities for any unforeseen circumstances.</p><p>Acute Watery Diarrhea (AWD) prevention was also conducted in Dassenech woreda in partnership with Pact Ethiopia funded by UN OCHA in 2010.</p>

                                <p>Women perform a diverse and wide workload in pastoralist communities including: constructing shelters, fetching water, collecting firewood, preparing food, taking care of children and the livestock and working on their small seasonal farms. However, their contribution is not recognized and there is significant imbalance between what women do and what women have. EPaRDA has been striving to empower women in its intervention area through  awareness creation workshops, training and provision of alternative livelihoods, and the introduction of labour saving mechanisms such as grinding mills. A workshop on gender awareness for subject matter specialist and the community was conducted in 2001 in Hamer and Bena-Tsemay woredas for 44 participants. EPaRDA has also introduced the involvement of women on conflict  resolution which  is later recognized the prominent role of women in decision-making. Women alongside the youth and elder representatives from Borana, Arbore and Hamer ethnic groups    actively participated in the peace conference and traditional peace ceremonies held at Elkuni TeleTele  woreda of Borana and then at Arbore and Asile of Hamer Woredas respectively, During the event the women had opportunity to air their views on various issues concerning peace and security in their localities. </p><p>Other interventions included the  establishments of women’s petty trading enterprises, women’s goat breeding groups, and women’s credit and saving groups. A 26 member women  group,  both goat beneficiaries  and  others, organized  themselves into credit and saving groups. They contributed 3 birr each and with their own total initial capital 78 birr and project money birr 1,000 added and they started petty trade. A 16-strong Braille Group was also formed into credit and  saving association. Their initial capital was birr 48 and that was supplemented by birr  500 loan  from the project.    These income generating groups have done well and hence encouraged more people to join the scheme. 120 women from 4 kebeles of Dassencech woreda have been organized into 6 credit and saving groups since 2014/2015. </p>

                                <p class="item-intro text-muted">Conflict Mitigation and Peace Building</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/peace-preview.png" alt="">
                                <p>In  pastoralist  areas  the  major  source  of  conflicts  revolve  around  access  to  the  use  of  natural  resources, mainly water and pasture. There are also other sources of conflict emanating from the cultural practices and  heroism,  and  asset  building  through  cattle  raiding.  In  addition,  the  demographic  upsurge  and  the proliferation of small arms have exacerbated the situation. </p><p>EPaRDA has been a pioneer in attempting to facilitate and organize in-country and cross-border (Kenya and  Ethiopia)  conflict  mitigation  and  peace  building  initiatives  for  the  pastoralist  communities  in  the south  Omo.  It  has  conducted  a  series  of  peace  making  processes,  of  which  the  first  one  was  made among  Arore,  Hamer  and  Borana.  The  second  peacemaking  was  among  Mursi,  Ari,  and  Bodi  and  the third  among  Hamer,Dassenech  ,  Nyangatom,  Karo,  Muguji,    Mursi  and  Bodi.  In  addition,  there  were several other internal efforts and and cross-border peacemaking endeavors at reducing tensions between the Turkana of Kenya and Dassenech and Nyangatom of Kenya. </p><p>EPaRDA  brought  face to  face  various  rival  neighboring  pastoral  ethnic  groups  to  discuss  long  standing rivalries.  Using  traditional  peace  settlement  and  conflict  mitigation  mechanisms  this  resulted  in unprecedented  peaceful  coexistence  among  pastoralists  that  were  historic  enemies.  The  methodologies  used  by  EPaRDA  to  implement  conflict  mitigation  and  peace  building  included;  utilizing  traditional peace  settlement  mechanisms  by  organizing  local  peace  conference  with  the  representatives  from  the government,  conflicting  groups  and  other  actors;  traditional  elders  managed  all-inclusive  inter community  dialogues  ;  peace  week  celebrations;  conflict  mitigation  and  peace  building  training,  and working  with  government  at  all  levels  to  establish  peace  committees  and  enhance  development  that creates  suitable  conditions  for  sustainable  peace.  The  inclusion  of  the  women  and  the  youth  of  the ethnic groups in the peace dialogues have been proved in making the peace building effective.</p>
